## Advent of Code 2022

This is my (belated) progress through https://adventofcode.com/2022.

I'ts been fun so far, so I'll try to play along this year as it comes out.

To run the code of a particular day, run `cargo run --bin day[number][a | b]`. There are two parts per day of the event which is why there is `day[number]a` and `day[number]b`.
