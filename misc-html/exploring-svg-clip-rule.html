                    it, but clip-rule="evenodd" only works when the (sub?) paths
                    are part of the same element, otherwise, it's the union of
                    the two paths like normal -->

                    I guess you can't reuse the same path definition for both
                    the stroke drawing and the clipping. It makes sense, but
                    just means I have to put more work into it. And yes, I tried
                    the following path definition with a Z at the end and before
                    the second M, just in case.
